# OpenFOAM-CFD-cases
This repository contains different cases from OpenFOAM Tutorials which serve as foundational ground to further built and develope more advance runs. OpenFOAM-7 was used and these simulations were perfomed using Intel Coreâ„¢ i7-4600U, 3.3GHz turbo, 32GB memory. 

I hope this proves useful to OpenFOAM commmunity in any way, shape or form.

Many Thanks
